# ESP32-Seizure-Detector
This project is a wearable Seizure Detection and Alert System built using ESP32, designed to detect abnormal physiological parameters and movement patterns associated with seizures. It uses real-time SpO2, Heart Rate, Accelerometer, and Vibration sensor data to identify possible seizure events and immediately trigger alerts via Blynk IoT.
